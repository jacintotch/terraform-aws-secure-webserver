# Secure AWS Web Server Deployment with Terraform

This project demonstrates Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles to deploy a secure web server on AWS using Terraform.

## 🛡️ Security Features Implemented

- **Custom VPC**: Isolated network environment
- **Minimal Security Groups**: Only necessary ports (SSH, HTTP) open
- **Structured Networking**: Public/private subnet design (foundation for scaling)
- **Least Privilege Principle**: Security groups follow minimal required access
